      <p class="intro">The Coronavirus pandemic upended life as it were for many Americans. According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/americans-have-changed-their-spending-habits-during-the-pandemic-heres-how.html">September cnbc.com
          article written by Megan Leonhardt</a>, roughly 64% of Americans say their spending habits have changed since the start of the
        pandemic in
        March.
      </p>

      <p> In a survey of 2500 adults conducted by Bank of America, both employed and unemployed Americans have made significant changes to their spending habits. While one might guess that people are attempting to save more money in preparation
        for a looming recession, research shows that we are instead simply spending our money differently. </p>

      <p>Spending categories, such as gym memberships, online shopping, and travel, have
        seen dramatic shifts. For example, travel would have normally been a much larger budget item during
        the
        summer months, but many people are opting to stay home and use that money for other household expenses. Additionally, the increase of people working from home caused a sudden decline in commute and dining expenses for several Americans.
      </p>

      <p> While it is unclear how and when our spending habits will return back to normal, here are the top three ways Americans have spent their money, roughly six months into the pandemic: </p>
